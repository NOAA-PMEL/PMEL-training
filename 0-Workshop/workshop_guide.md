## 1. GitHub Website and Navigation

1. **User Site vs. NOAA-PMEL**
    <br> All work being accomplished under a funded NOAA project **MUST** be commited to a repository on the **NOAA-PMEL** page.    

    Work performed for personal use, tutorials, example code, etc. may be saved in repositories on your personal GitHub page.

    To change from your personal page to the NOAA-PMEL page, click on the switch dashboard content dropdown, seen here:

1. **Your Profile**
    <br> ![alt text](images/github_mainpage_profile.png "Your Profile")

    To access your profile page, select the dropdown menu in the upper right-hand corner of your webpage
    with your icon.  From this page you will see your public profile which includes which repositories you work in, and any information about yourself you may provide.

1. **Settings**
    <br> ![alt text](images/github_mainpage_settings.png "Settings")

    Your settings page controls your access to GitHub, security and other configurations.

    NOAA requires Two-Factor Authentication (TFA) on the GitHub website.  To set this up, select "Security" from the "Personal Settings" list:

    <br>
2. Edit and commit a file from the website
    <br>

--------------
## 3. Project Management tool
1. Create a task within the "GitHub Training Test Board" project
    <br>
    1. Task name is: "YourName - Create an Issue"
2. Move that task to "In progress"

--------------

2. Tag Issue to Project "GitHub Training Test Board"
    <br>
3. Apply a label to the issue
    <br>
    1. Stick with existing labels
4. Add yourself as an Assignee

##5. Creating a wiki

## 6. Creating a repository
When creating a repository, you must remember that all funded NOAA work must be created within the **NOAA-PMEL** page.  

The task of creating a repository is fairly straightfoward.  In this example, we will create a new repository within our personal account to minimize how many training repositories end up in **NOAA-PMEL**
1. From your dashboard, select "+" > "New Repository"<br>

2. Fill out the fields based on what you want your repository to reflect<br>
   
    ![alt text](images/github_createrepo_form.png "Two-Factor Authentication")
    1. Adding a description is useful for external users to understand what the project or code does
    2. Public vs. Private: Private repos cost PMEL $, so use Public as much as you can.
    3. Initializing with a README is good practice.
    4. Add a license:  For code that you are willing to share openly, the Unlicense is a good choice.
    5. Add .gitignore: This sets up your repository to ignore files generated by compilers, tools, etc. that are not required in the repository.
3. Press "Create repository".  You have now created a new repo!<br>

4. To Clone a repo (use it from Git tool) click on the "Clone or download" button.<br>

    1. Copy the link and use with your Git tool on your desktop or server to interact with this GitHub repository. <br>
