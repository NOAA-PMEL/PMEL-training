## 1. GitHub Website and Navigation

1. User Site vs. NOAA-PMEL
    <br> All work being accomplished under a funded NOAA project **MUST** be commited to a repository on the **NOAA-PMEL** page.    

    Work performed for personal use, tutorials, example code, etc. may be saved in repositories on your personal GitHub page.

    To change from your personal page to the NOAA-PMEL page, click on the switch dashboard content dropdown, seen here:

1. Your Profile
    <br> ![alt text](images/github_mainpage_profile.png "Your Profile")

    To access your profile page, select the dropdown menu in the upper right-hand corner of your webpage
    with your icon.  From this page you will see your public profile which includes which repositories you work in, and any information about yourself you may provide.

1. Settings

    Your settings page controls your access to GitHub, security and other configurations.

    NOAA requires Two-Factor Authentication (TFA) on the GitHub website.  To set this up, select "Security" from the "Personal Settings" list:
